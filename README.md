# JHearthstone

## What is JHearthstone?
JHearthstone is my recreation of Hearthstone. It will eventually<sup>TM</sup> have all the cards in the game and have the correct interactions. The game is multiplayer and runs over a custom built server. Both the client and server are written in Java. Just start up the server, run two clients, and have them play against each other. There will be more detailed instructions soon and hopefully some precomiled JAR files for the server and client to make life easier.

## Images
Here are some images from the game (yea, i know it looks like garbage).

## How is this different from Metastone?
This isn't different from Metastone. I have actually contributed a bit to the Metastone repository. I just wanted to learn about creating a multiplayer game and Hearthstone is a good example of one. Metastone is the much better version of this and I recommend you check it out if this sort of stuff interests you. The community and features over there are super incredible. 

## Current State
<del>The game is currently in a fairly well developed state. The next step is to add polish and finetune everything. Then, slowly add new cards to the game.</del> 

Looking back on this project, it is a complete mess. It should be totally rewritten with some planning done beforehand.

## Contributions
If you want to contribute, please feel free. Below are a list of things that need to be done. Lots of stuff to do.

TODO LIST
