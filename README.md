# JHearthstone

## What is JHearthstone?
JHearthstone is my recreation of Hearthstone. It will (eventually) have all the cards in the game and have the correct interactions. The game is multiplayer and runs over a custom built server. Everything (the client and server) are written in java. Just start up the server, run two clients, and have them play against each other. There will be more detailed instructions soon and hopefully some precomiled JAR files for the server and client to make life easier.

## Images
Here are some images from the game (yea, i know it looks like garbage).

## How is this different from Metastone?
This isn't different from Metastone. I have actually contributed a bit to the Metastone repositroy. I just wanted to learn about creating a multiplayer game and Hearthstone is a good example of one. Metastone is the much better version of this and I recommend you check it ouy and this sort of stuff interests you. The community and features over there are super incredible. 

## Current State
Currently, I have the basic stuff down. The client and server are basically done. They can talk to each other. You can play cards, attack, and win game. The interactions that don't work are event triggers, targeting entities, and spells/weapons.

## Contributions
If you want to contribute, please feel free. Below are a list of things that need to be done. Lots of stuff to do.

TODO LIST
- ADD SECRETS/QUESTS
- MAKE UI LOOK BETTER (Maybe using a web client or Love2D)
